Creating an asynchronous list comprehension is quite a bit different than creating a regular list comprehension. As you can see, it takes a lot more code to make it work. Other than adding the ability to do more asynchronously out of the box, the new asynchronous generator is actually supposed to be 2x faster than an equivalent implemented as an asynchronous iterator according to PEP 525.
